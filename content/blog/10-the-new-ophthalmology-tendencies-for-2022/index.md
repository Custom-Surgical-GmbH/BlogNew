As the worldwide population ages, the demand for quality eye care keeps increasing. Luckily, we're living in a moment with better access to treatments and therapies than ever before, thanks to ophthalmology having a quickly advancing field that brings year after year several incredible new technologies to promote good health care for the eyes.

As there are many exciting new trends and technologies in development, ophthalmologists need to be aware of them. That's why we select a few that will be shaping the future of eye care in 2022 and further. Check out what's next for eye care:


<h2><b> 3D Printing </h2></b>
One of the most exciting advances in ophthalmology is creating medical models and implants from 3D technology - a process that creates three-dimensional solid objects from a digital model.

The use of this technology has now become more affordable than ever, and the 3D printings can help ophthalmologists develop customized implants that fill their patients' needs, besides assisting them in planning surgeries and even creating artificial corneas, which is thrilling news!

Another example is <a href="https://www.bioniko.com/" class="links_post">Bioniko</a>, who has 3D-printed eye models for cataract surgery, retina, glaucoma and cornea. In this reels above you can see a Bioniko eye in a iris-satured Wet Lab recorded with MicroREC.

<h2><b> Retina Imaging </h2></b>
Ophthalmology Retina imaging has been developed over decades until we'd be able to MicroREC in 4k, for example. As a result, it's now easier and faster to diagnose retinal problems and diseases in patients.

</a>

The pandemic has driven the healthcare technology landscape forward, and a new wave of tech-savvy patients are demanding modern options that include high-resolution images of the cornea, retina, and other structures within the eye. The possibilities that come with MicroREC and other imaging are endless.


<h2><b> Artificial intelligence </h2></b>
Artificial intelligence (also known as AI) is already a reality (and an ally) in many fields of work, and it wouldn't be different in health. Though it might seem like something that comes from a sci-fi movie, AI means that a computer system has the ability to learn and work independently of a person.

Artificial intelligence can be used by ophthalmologists for image recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. AI is also able to help physicians diagnose and treat eye diseases more effectively through their easy learning.


<h2><b> Laser Eye Surgery </h2></b>
Laser eye surgery has become so popular over the years that even Taylor Swift has talked about her successful procedure, which is good advertising for ophthalmologists. One of the major advantages of this laser eye surgery is being considered safe and effective.

Nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism can be corrected with laser eye surgery by removing a thin layer of tissue from the cornea. It's a very recommended procedure option, and patients are satisfied with the results.


<h2><b> Synthetic Cornea Implants </h2></b>
Synthetic cornea implants may be a relatively new treatment option for people with corneal blindness. Still, studies have shown that these implants, made with biocompatible materials, are very effective at restoring vision in those patients.

And the best part? People of all ages can use these implants that don't require any post-operative care.
