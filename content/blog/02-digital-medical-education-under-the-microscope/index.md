Creating and sharing surgical videos has become an essential part of medical education, especially after 2020. The restrictions of staying together in one lab, training, or operating room pushed doctors to adapt and use online tools in new creative ways. As a result, the <b>virtual medical community has grown and has become more active</b>.

With smart, innovative technologies like the MicroREC, medical education for microscopy procedures can be performed online through webinars with <b>live surgery or examination streamed directly from the doctors’ smartphones</b>.

MicroREC connects microscopes to smartphones. Doctors can use the phone’s apps to join online events and share live high-quality imaging. The doctor capturing the imaging can share his phone’s screen, and all participants in the online event can visualize the procedure.

This innovative approach was adapted by <a href="https://oftalmouniversity.com/" target="t_blank">Oftalmo University</a>. They created a blended hybrid education system with the physical and online campuses coming together and <b>hundreds of doctors worldwide joining live webinars and streamings</b>.

When doctors or instructors stream imaging with a patient, they can mute all the participants in a webinar and manage their interaction after the procedure.

Apart from webinars, doctors enjoy the possibility to stream their surgeries live with a MicroREC from their phones directly on their social media, through tools like Instagram Live or Facebook Live.

MicroREC can be used with smartphones, microscopes, and slit lamps, thanks to its innovative modular structure. <b>It can be installed and ready to use in minutes</b>.

Doctors use also MicroREC to record their microscopy procedures with their smartphones. Edit, share privately, organize their work or upload them to cloud storage without relying on external devices or technicians to operate bulk recording systems attached to their microscopes.

Medical education is enriched with new accessible MedTech solutions that involve simple devices like a smartphone in medical imagery recording and telehealth. With doctors worldwide coming together in the virtual space, we expect to see the digital medical revolution move faster than ever and enable new ways to promote excellence in healthcare, remote collaboration, and knowledge sharing.
