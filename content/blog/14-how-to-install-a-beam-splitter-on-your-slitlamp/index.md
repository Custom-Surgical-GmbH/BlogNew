Many people don’t know what a beam splitter is and wonder if they need it or not to use a smartphone adaptor on the microscope or slitlamp.

The beam splitter is found on most trinocular microscopes and some slitlamps. The beam splitter splits the light that travels up to the camera in two directions. <b>Custom Surgical Beam Splitter sents 50% of the light to the eyepieces and 50% to the smartphone camera.</b>

If you want to understand more about how beam splitter works, watch the video above.
