Technological advances have been <b>essential</b> to medicine development, allowing outstanding achievements, like accurate diagnosis and procedures being done less invasively. For example, using images to detect and treat eye diseases, mainly crucial during the diagnosis phase, is one of the evolutions that modernize ophthalmology.

Here are some things to know about why high-quality images are so important in ophthalmology:

<h2><b> Images Exams are very precise </b></h2>
That's the main reason they're so important: exam images are allies of doctors to a precise diagnosis. In addition, the better the quality of the image recorded, the easier to track a possible problem in a patient's eyes - did you know that Custom Surgical can help you to <a href="customsurgical.co" target="t_blank" class="links_post">MicroREC up to 8k</a> quality thanks to our high-quality German lens?

<h2><b> They’re becoming more accessible to people </b></h2>
Images have been evolutioning over the years, becoming cheaper and sharper. Thanks to smartphone imaging development, approximately 85% of the population has a smartphone with a good camera. It is becoming democratic for most of the world's population.

Most ophthalmologists could have high-quality imaging without having a professional camera. They already have a constantly updated camera every time they change their smartphone.

<h2><b> a great way to follow the evolution of a treatment  </b></h2>
The images have also been useful several times — for many surgeries, for example, they are essential in monitoring the evolution of certain diseases. High-quality images are easier to compare every detail from before, during, and after every procedure.

Some treatments only present noticeable results in the long term, so a set of before and after images can help a lot when demonstrating that the treatment was really effective, being able to compare both moments. 


<h2><b> a faster way to track any possible diseases or problems with the eyes  </b></h2>
Through retinography, for example, it is possible to map the structures of the eyes. The technique records high-resolution photographs of the eye's retina, optic nerve, and fundus. That's an easy and effective way to diagnose glaucoma, myopia, macular changes, or other retinal diseases.
