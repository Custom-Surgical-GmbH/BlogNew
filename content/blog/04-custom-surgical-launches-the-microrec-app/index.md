In November 2020, Custom Surgical launched the MicroREC App, a unique mobile application for managing medical photos and videos.
Earlier, Custom Surgical launched the MicroREC hardware solution for connecting diagnostic and surgical microscopic equipment to smartphones to capture high-quality imaging quickly and efficiently.

The MicroREC system incorporates quality German lenses, innovative engineering, and additive manufacturing, with a modular design that allows doctors to customize the device and achieve <b>compatibility with most microscopy, slit lamps, and smartphones</b>.

Adopted globally by medical professionals in over 30 countries, the MicroREC highlights the need for a software solution on smartphones tailored to the specific requirements for capturing microscopy imaging.
The app enables doctors to capture images and videos from microscopes in the <b>vertical or horizontal format, no matter the system's positioning on the microscope equipment</b>.

It allows them to <b>optimize the camera's settings for high-quality imaging depending on the lighting conditions</b> for each microscopy procedure and operating environment.

During COVID-19, medical professionals embraced digital solutions that allow collaborations and continuous medical education, making this app a valuable tool for <b>telemedicine, training, sharing on social media platforms, and presentations in webinars</b>.

The app is now available for free on the iOS App Store, and it is scheduled to have an Android version released at the beginning of 2021.
