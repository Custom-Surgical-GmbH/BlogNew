<h1><b>This is why you should start recording your procedures.</b></h1>

Everyday MedTechs and the use of the internet change how we practice and promote medicine and health. From simple actions such as receiving exam results on your mobile phone or having a second opinion from another colleague in real-time, technology is getting more present in our lives daily to improve it.

MicroREC is one of the changes that technology provides to improve the future of ophthalmology - we even presented <a href="https://blog.customsurgical.co/07-5-ways-to-use-MicroREC-as-a-working-tool/" class="links_post" target="t_blank">5 great ways</a> to use it. Today, we will talk about <i><b>why</b></i> you should start recording your procedures using MicroREC.

Are you trying to explain to your patients how procedures like cataract surgery and lensectomy are done? With MicroREC, you can create videos and photos that simplify the process your patient will go through, cleaning any possible doubts.

It's also great for patients' safety and doctors' legal protection and can be used to have a patient history that can be easily accessed.

You can use a phone adaptor for microscopes to do it. Such as MicroREC. What changes between a regular phone adaptor to MicroREC is the quality of german lenses, and it does not occupy the binoculars, letting your work freely without interruptions.

If you're also a med teacher, go beyond representations from books and bring real cases to classes. It's very easy to add photos and videos to presentations, stream them or send them to your students directly from your device. Here you can see an example of how <a href= "https://oftalmouniversity.com/" class="links_post" target="t_blank">Ophthalmo University</a> use to teach residents from all over the world with our optical system to live stream their classes.

Are you going to a congress or a medical event? You can also share with your colleagues and even present your own material as you prefer: creating your own material previously or live streaming.

We know it’s getting more and more popular to use social media to advertise a business, from lawyers to writers. It wouldn’t be different with doctors - and that’s an excellent reason you should start recording your procedures. Once you have them, how about posting them on your social media professional profile?

Feeling ready to start? With our <a href= "http://onelink.to/nqua9j" target="t_blank" class="links_post">Custom Surgical app</a>, you can create your own photos and videos in vertical or horizontal format, no matter the system's positioning on the microscope equipment. You can do your MicroREC from microscopes such as Alcon, Zeiss, leica, Zumax, Takagi and Haag-Streit. And the best part is that our system offers you autonomy, as you can optimize the camera’s settings for high-quality imaging depending on the lighting conditions for each microscopy procedure and operating environment. It has never been so easy and efficient to make a diagnosis using smartphones.
